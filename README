Dimensionality reduction tools in python
========================================

Here are some tools I use in dimensionality reduction research. So far
on error measures (trustworthiness, continuity) for datasets are
implemented, but I might get around implementing something else if or
when I have need for them.

You need to have numpy installed to run the programs. These are
python2 programs.

Programs
--------

dr-error.py C
  alculate error measures for original and projected
  datasets. Measures currently supported are trustworthiness and
  continuity.
